   <h3><center><u>DATA SCIENCE</center></h3><br></u><br>
   <h4>Data science provides meaningful information based on large amounts of complex data or big data. Data science, or data-driven science, combines different 
   fields of work in statistics and computation to interpret data for decision-making purposes.</h4>
   <h4>Data is drawn from different sectors, channels, and platforms including cell phones, social media, e-commerce sites, healthcare surveys, and Internet searches.
   The increase in the amount of data available opened the door to a new field of study based on big data—the massive data sets that contribute to the creation of better 
   operational tools in all sectors. </h4><div><b>IMP:</b><i>Data science, or data-driven science, uses big data and machine learning to interpret data for 
   decision-making purposes.</div></i><img src="C:\Users\Dniharika\OneDrive\Desktop\NIHARIKA\WEB INTERNSHIP\DS pic.jpg" align="right" height="500" width="500">
   <h4>he continually increasing access to data is possible due to advancements in technology and collection techniques. Individuals buying patterns and behavior can be
   monitored and predictions made based on the information gathered.</h4>
   <h4>However, the ever-increasing data is unstructured and requires parsing for effective decision making. This process is complex and time-consuming for companies—hence,
   the emergence of data science.</h4>
