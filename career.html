 <a href="D:\WI\CAREER WI\AI.html"><h2>1.Artificial Intelligence:</h2></a>
 <p>Artificial Intelligence(AI), the ability of a digital computer or computer-controlled robot to
 perform tasks commonly associated with intelligent beings.<p>
 <a href="D:\WI\CAREER WI\ML.html"><h2>2.Machine Learning:</h2></a>
 <p>Machine Learning (ML) is a type of artificial intelligence (AI) that allows software applications to become more accurate at predicting outcomes without being explicitly programmed to do so. Machine learning algorithms use historical data as
 input to predict new output values.</p>
 <h2><a href="D:\WI\CAREER WI\dl.html">3.Deep Learning:</h2></a>
 <p>Deep learning is an artificial intelligence (AI) function that imitates the workings of the human brain in processing data and creating patterns for use in decision making. Deep learning is a subset of machine learning in artificial intelligence that has networks capable of learning unsupervised from data that
 is unstructured or unlabeled. Also known as deep neural learning or deep neural network.</p>
 <h2><a href="D:\WI\CAREER WI\ds.html">4.Data Science:</h2></a>
 <p>Data science is the field of study that combines domain expertise, programming skills, and knowledge of mathematics and statistics to extract meaningful insights from data. Data science practitioners apply machine learning algorithms to numbers, text, images, video, audio, and more to produce artificial intelligence (AI) systems to perform tasks that ordinarily require human intelligence. In turn, these systems generate 
 insights which analysts and business users can translate into tangible business value.</p>
